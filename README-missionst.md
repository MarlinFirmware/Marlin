#### Marlin 3D printer firmware with modifications by Mission Street Manufacturing

This repository contains the source code to the Marlin firmware for 3D printer
electronics boards, with some small configuration changes so that it operates
correctly on the hardware in our 3D printer.

You can find more information about Marlin on the [RepRap wiki](http://reprap.org/wiki/Marlin)
or at the [official Marlin GitHub repository](https://github.com/ErikZalm/Marlin).

The official Marlin firmware is licensed under the [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html),
and we are licensing our modifications under the same terms.

There is a lot more technical detail on Marlin in the [official README file](https://github.com/ErikZalm/Marlin/blob/Marlin_v1/README.md)
