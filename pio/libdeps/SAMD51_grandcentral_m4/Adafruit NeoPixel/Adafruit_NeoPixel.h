// The order of primary colors in the NeoPixel data stream can vary among
// device types, manufacturers and even different revisions of the same
// item.  The third parameter to the Adafruit_NeoPixel constructor encodes
// the per-pixel byte offsets of the red, green and blue primaries (plus
// white, if present) in the data stream -- the following #defines provide
// an easier-to-use named version for each permutation. e.g. NEO_GRB
// indicates a NeoPixel-compatible device expecting three bytes per pixel,
// with the first byte transmitted containing the green value, second
// containing red and third containing blue. The in-memory representation
// of a chain of NeoPixels is the same as the data-stream order; no
// re-ordering of bytes is required when issuing data to the chain.
// Most of these values won't exist in real-world devices, but it's done
// this way so we're ready for it (also, if using the WS2811 driver IC,
// one might have their pixels set up in any weird permutation).

// Bits 5,4 of this value are the offset (0-3) from the first byte of a
// pixel to the location of the red color byte.  Bits 3,2 are the green
// offset and 1,0 are the blue offset.  If it is an RGBW-type device
// (supporting a white primary in addition to R,G,B), bits 7,6 are the
// offset to the white byte...otherwise, bits 7,6 are set to the same value
// as 5,4 (red) to indicate an RGB (not RGBW) device.
// i.e. binary representation:
// 0bWWRRGGBB for RGBW devices
// 0bRRRRGGBB for RGB
