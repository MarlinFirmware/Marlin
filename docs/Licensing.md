# Licensing

Marlin is published under the [GPL License][License] <br>
because we believe in open development.

The GPL comes with both rights and obligations.

Whether you use **Marlin Firmware** as the driver <br>
for your open / closed source product, you must:

- Keep Marlin open
- Provide your compatible Marlin source <br>
  code to end users upon request

The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin <br>
license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your <br>
modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products like <br>
**3D Printers**, **CNC**, ... that are closed source or crippled by a <br>
patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware <br>
or, better yet, make your own.
