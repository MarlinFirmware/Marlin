# Installation

In the following you can find instructions <br>
for building and installing **Marlin 2.0** .

<br>

<br>

## Configuration

Before building Marlin you'll need to <br>
configure it for your specific hardware.

Your vendor should have already provided source <br>
code with configurations for the installed firmware.

In case you ever decide to upgrade <br>
 you'll need updated configuration files.

Marlin users have contributed dozens of tested <br>
example configurations to get you started.

Visit the **[Configurations Repository][Configurations]** to find <br>
the right configuration for your hardware.
