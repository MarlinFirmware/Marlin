# Summary

This is an inductive z-probe mount for an 18mm inductive sensor on the Duplicator i3 Plus with  a Diiicooler installed.  This mounts between the extruder fan and heatsink, replacing those spacers that fall into the case every time you remove the fan.

The spacers are not a precision part, but you'll want to make sure the mounts are roughly the same size once printed and sand them down to about 9.3mm if they are too large

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Wanhao
Printer: Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus
Rafts: No
Supports: Doesn't Matter
Resolution: 0.2
Infill: 100%

Notes: 
Since this sits very close to the heater block, it should be printed in a high-temperature filament such as PETG.  If you don't use supports, you may have to drill out the screw holes to allow for clear passage
