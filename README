This RepRap firmware is a mashup between Sprinter, grbl and many original parts.
 (https://github.com/kliment/Sprinter)
 (https://github.com/simen/grbl/tree)

Derived from Sprinter and Grbl by Erik van der Zalm.
Sprinters lead developers are Kliment and caru.
Grbls lead developer is Simen Svale Skogsrud.
It has been adapted to the Ultimaker Printer by:
Bernhard Kubicek, Matthijs Keuper, Bradley Feldman, and others...


Features:
 - Interrupt based movement with real linear acceleration
 - High steprate
 - Look ahead (Keep the speed high when possible. High cornering speed)
 - Interrupt based temperature protection
 - preliminary support for Matthew Roberts advance algorithm 
   For more info see: http://reprap.org/pipermail/reprap-dev/2011-May/003323.html
 - Full endstop support
 - Simple LCD support (16x2)
 - SD Card support
 - Provisions for Bernhard Kubicek's new hardware control console and 20x4 lcd

This firmware is optimized for Ultimaker's gen6 electronics (including the Ultimaker 1.5.x daughterboard and Arduino Mega 2560).

The default baudrate is 115200.
