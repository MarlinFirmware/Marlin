This is my fork of Marlin 1.1.1 3D printer firmware.
It is configured for my Tevo Tarantula printer for the parts that is use.
It will be updated only based on my configuration, but with stock Tarantula parts.

My current setup currently consists of: 

Original sized bed
Original hotend
Inductive sensor for Z axis (LJ12A3-4-Z/BY PNP NO)
