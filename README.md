## Release Candidate -- Marlin 1.1.0-RC4 - 24 March 2016

__Not for production use – use with caution!__

You can download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases). (The latest "stable" release of Marlin is 1.0.2-1.)

You'll always find the latest Release Candidate in the ["RC" branch](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/RC). Bugs that we find in the current Release Candidate are patched in the ["RCBugFix" branch](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/RC), so during beta testing this is where you can always find the latest code on its way towards release.

Future development (Marlin 1.2 and beyond) takes place in the [MarlinDev repository](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDev/).

## Submitting Patches
Proposed patches should be submitted as a Pull Request against the [RCBugFix](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/RCBugFix) branch.

- Don't submit new feature proposals. The RCBugFix branch is for fixing bugs in existing features.
- Do submit questions and concerns. The "naive" question is often the one we forget to ask.
- Follow the proper coding style. Pull requests with styling errors will be delayed. See our [Coding Standards](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/wiki/DNE-Coding-Standards) page for more information.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
