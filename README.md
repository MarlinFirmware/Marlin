 Documentation has moved to [marlinfirmware.org](http://www.marlinfirmware.org).

## Release Branch

The Release branch contains the latest tagged version of Marlin (currently 1.0.2 – January 2015). It also includes a version 1.0.1 (December 2014). Any version of Marlin before 1.0.1 (when we started tagging versions) can be collectively referred to as Marlin 1.0.0.

For the most up-to-date Marlin code, please go to the [Development branch](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/Development) – __Not for production use – use with caution!__ When reporting any issues, please check to see if they are resolved in the Development branch first. But let us know if issues exist in tagged releases so we may document and patch them.

## Current Status: In Development

Marlin development is being accelerated to catch up with a long list of issues. Check the Issues and Pull Requests links on the right to to see what we are currently working on.
