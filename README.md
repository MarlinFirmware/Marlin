 Documentation has moved to [marlinfirmware.org](http://www.marlinfirmware.org).

## Development Only

__Not for production use – use with caution!__

The [dev branch](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDev/tree/dev) contains the most up-to-date Marlin code. When reporting any issues, please check to see if they are resolved in this branch first. But let us know if issues exist in tagged releases so that we can document and patch them.

## Testing
The [RC branch](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDev/tree/RC) will contain the latest pre-release candidate.

## Submitting Patches
Development patches should be submitted as a Pull Request against the [master](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDev/tree/master) branch
 
For the latest tagged version of Marlin (currently 1.0.2 – January 2015) you should switch to the [Release Repository](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin).

## Current Status: Bug Fixing

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/Documentation/COPYING.md) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
