## Marlin 2.0 Bugfix Branch

__Not for production use. Use with caution!__

Marlin 2.0 is bringing open source RepRap firmware to the next level with support of much faster 32-bit processor boards.

This branch is for patches to the latest 2.0.x release version. Periodically this branch will form the basis for the next minor 2.0.x release.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Marlin 2.0 adds a new abstraction layer so that Marlin can build and run on 32-bit boards while still retaining the ability to build and run on 8-bit AVR. In this way, new features can be enhanced for more powerful platforms while still supporting AVR, whereas splitting up the code makes it hard to follow these changes and keep them in sync.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
