Please test this firmware and let us know if it misbehaves in any way. Volunteers are standing by!

## Marlin 2.0

Marlin 2.0 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

You are still able to download older **[Releases]** of Marlin.

## Example Configurations

Before building Marlin you'll need to configure it for your specific hardware. Your vendor should have already provided source code with configurations for the installed firmware, but if you ever decide to upgrade you'll need updated configuration files. Marlin users have contributed dozens of tested example configurations to get you started. Visit the [MarlinFirmware/Configurations][Configurations] repository to find the right configuration for your hardware.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license][License] because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
