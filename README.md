# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware
<img align="right" src="../../raw/1.1.x/buildroot/share/pixmaps/logo/marlin-250.png" />

Marlin is an optimized firmware for [RepRap 3D printers](http://reprap.org/) based on the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) platform. First created in 2011 for RepRap and Ultimaker printers, today Marlin drives a majority of the world's most popular 3D printers. Marlin delivers outstanding print quality with unprecedented control over the process.

## Marlin 1.1.x

The 1.1.x branch is home to all tagged releases of Marlin 1.1 (final version 1.1.9 – July 2018).

## Marlin 2.0 Bugfix Branch
=======
This branch will receive no further updates. All future development —including all bug fixes— will take place in the [`bugfix-2.0.x`](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/bugfix-2.0.x) branch, which will also serve as the root for all future Marlin development. Be sure to test [`bugfix-2.0.x`](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/bugfix-2.0.x) before reporting any bugs you find in 1.1.9.
>>>>>>> 1.1.x

Marlin 1.1.9 is the final release of the 8-bit flat version of Marlin Firmware. A monumental amount of talent and effort has gone into its production, and thanks are due to many people around the world. Throughout Marlin 1.1 development we worked closely with the community, contributors, vendors, host developers, library developers, etc. to improve the quality, configurability, and compatibility of Marlin Firmware, all while continuing to support a wide variety of Arduino-based boards.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Marlin 2.0 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level with support for much faster 32-bit processor boards.

This branch is for patches to the latest 2.0.x release version. Periodically this branch will form the basis for the next minor 2.0.x release.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.9](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). We've posted detailed instructions on how to [build Marlin 2.0 for ARM](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arm.html).

## Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Marlin 2.0 adds a new abstraction layer so that Marlin can build and run on 32-bit boards while still retaining full 8-bit AVR compatibility. In this way, features can be enhanced for more powerful platforms while still supporting AVR, whereas splitting up the code would make it harder to maintain and keep everything in sync.

Marlin is published under the [GPLv3 license](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/blob/1.0.x/COPYING.md) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.
