## Universal RET6/RCT6 chips: G32, N32, (working on H32), Creality 4.2.7 and 4.2.2 boards

I will be working on more upgrades and features and tweaks along the way. Enjoy using this fork of Marlin as I intend it to be the best. It is easy to use and convenient. So far I really enjoy the new settings and toolbar for the main menu. There is a variety of parameters and options that can be changed without having to reflash the firmware.
