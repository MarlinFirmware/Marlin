# Voxelab Aquila 

This fork was created made so [Alex's Firmware](https://github.com/alexqzd/Marlin) works with Creality 4.2.7 boards that are most commonly replaced on Voxelab Aquila X2 and original machines. I have compiled firmware that speeds up the printer and enables some extra settings. These firmwares also work with the original mainboards using G32 and N32 chips. (H32 chip machines still not compatible). 

My Configuration files are under Configuration Files folder - specifically the firmware I use is compiled from ConfigurationA.h, and the firmware I compiled for everyone else under Releases does not have the A. 


## Forked from Alex's Marlin firmware for Voxelab Aquila, forked from Ender 3 V2 JyersUI

## Releases
Precompiled files can be found in the [releases section of GitHub](https://github.com/classicrocker883/Marlin/releases).

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
