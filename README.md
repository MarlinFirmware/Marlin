# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware
<img align="right" src="Documentation/Logo/Marlin%20Logo%20GitHub.png" />

 Documentation has moved to [marlinfirmware.org](http://www.marlinfirmware.org).

## Development Branch is DEPRECATED in this repository.

Our development effort has moved to a companion Github repository [MarlinDev](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDev/).

That repository is based on the same git tree as this one. To move to the new repository, Simply add the new one as an additional git remote to your existing infrastruction and begin fetching and syncing to that repository rather than this one.

## No new Pull Requests will be accepted on THIS branch.

As soon as we complete the transition and close the remaining items based on it, this branch will be deleted.

## New Pull Requests must be made to the [MarlinDev Project Repository](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDev/)
