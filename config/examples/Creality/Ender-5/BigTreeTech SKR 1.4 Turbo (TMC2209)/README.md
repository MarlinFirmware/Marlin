# Modded Ender-5 Config with SKR 1.4 Turbo

This config is for an Ender-5 upgraded with the following mods:
- BigTreeTech SKR 1.4 Turbo
- TMC2209 drivers (sensorless homing)
- E3D all metal hotend (changes thermistor and max temps)
- "Extreme mode" for all-metal hotend (higher max temp which is not recommended for long-term use by E3D)
- Chamber setup (configures chamber with the thermistor in the E1 thermistor pin on the SKR 1.4 and the heater in the second heater pins beside the bed heater)

Other mods not listed here may also be enabled in this config, so proceed with caution.
