# Anycubic Mega Zero 2.0 Support

This configuration is based on the published firmware v0.0.4 from Anycubic. It is **not** the authoritative source, but has been carefully re-built by looking at their firmware and inferring the base version and configuration they used.

## Bitmaps

The bootscreen came from Anycubic's firmware. The custom status screen was recreated from images.
