# Where have all the configurations gone?

Marlin configurations for specific machines are now maintained in their own repository at:

## https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/tree/dev

Configuration files for use with the nightly `dev` branch can be downloaded from:

## https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/archive/dev

Place old-style `Configuration.h` and `Configuration_adv.h` files into the `Marlin` folder.
For new granular configurations replace the `config` folder with your own `config` folder.
