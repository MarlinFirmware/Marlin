/**
 * Least Squares Best Fit by Roxy and Ed Williams
 *
 * This algorithm is high speed and has a very small code footprint.
 * Its results are identical to both the Iterative Least-Squares published
 * earlier by Roxy and the QR_SOLVE solution. If used in place of QR_SOLVE
 * it saves roughly 10K of program memory. It also does not require all of
 * coordinates to be present during the calculations. Each point can be
 * probed and then discarded.
