# Example Configuration for BQ [Hephestos 2](http://www.bq.com/uk/hephestos-2)
This configuration file is based on the original configuration file shipped with the heavily modifiied Marlin fork by BQ. The orignal firmware and configuration file can be found at [BQ Github repository](https://github.com/bq/Marlin).

NOTE: The look and feel of the Hephestos 2 while navigating the LCD menu will change by using the original Marlin firmware.
