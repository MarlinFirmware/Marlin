# Example Configuration for Vellemann K8200
* Configuration files for **Vellemann K8200** (with VM8201 - LCD Option for K8200)
* K8200 is a 3Drag clone - configuration should work with 3Drag http://reprap.org/wiki/3drag, too. Please report.

* updated manually with parameters form genuine Vellemann Firmware "firmware_k8200_marlinv2" based on the recent development branch

* VM8201 uses "DISPLAY_CHARSET_HD44870_JAPAN" and "ULTIMAKERCONTROLLER"
* german (de) translation with umlaut is supported now - thanks to @AnHardt for the great hardware based umlaut support

I (@CONSULitAS) tested the changes on my K8200 with 20x4-LCD and Arduino 1.0.5 for Windows (SD library added to IDE manually) - everything works well.
