This example configuration is for the CL-260 (and if you edit Z_MAX_POS to 300, also for the CL-260MAX)

(The printer is available on AliExpress; be aware that this is not a beginner's
printer -- it will need tweaking and some parts replaced before being decent.)

The printer comes with an quite old Marlin, the sources are available here:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1635830/ and I recommend to replace them.

The setting "works" for my printer and the extruder using my calibration value.
You might want to tweak some settings, e.g enable EEPROM, increase default Z speed,
adjust homing speeds ...

Have fun!
