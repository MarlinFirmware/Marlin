# Configuration for Velleman K8400 Vertex
http://www.k8400.eu/

Configuration files for the K8400, ported upstream from the official Velleman firmware.
Like it's predecessor, (K8200), the K8400 is a 3Drag clone. There are some minor differences, documented in pins_K8400.h.

Single and dual head configurations provided. Copy the correct Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h to the /Marlin/ directory.

**NOTE: This configuration includes the community sourced feed rate fix. Use 100% feed rate in Repetier!**

For implementation and updated K8400 firmware, see https://github.com/birkett/Velleman-K8400-Firmware
