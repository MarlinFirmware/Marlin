# Flying bear P905H configuration for Marlin Firmware

This configuration set was tested on single extruder P905H.
Probably it is compatible with other similar FlyingBear printers.

Overall it is working more smoothly than original firmware.

## Build HOWTO
  - Install the latest non-beta Arduino software IDE/toolset: http://www.arduino.cc
  - Download the Marlin firmware
  - Configure Arduino IDE 
    - board: Arduino/Genuino Mega or Mega 2560
    - CPU: ATmega2560 (Mega 2560)
  - Copy *.h and *.ino files to Marlin firmware folder
  - Now you can open this folder in Arduino IDE and flash your printer
