This is the configuration file for Marlin 1.1.8 for the Anycubic i3 Mega Ultrabase with Trigorilla 8 bit mainboard.
Please note that there are also i3 Mega Ultrabase printers with a 32 bit board. Marlin 8 bit can not be flashed on those boards!

Navigate to the info screen on the TFT display, it tells you which version you have. Firmware V1.1.1 = 8 bit Marlin
and V1.4 is 32 bit 'something' firmware. You can also check by opening the case at the bottom and inspecting the motherboard.
If you have replaceable drivers, it's probably 8 bit Marlin. Intregraded stepper drivers = 32 bit (and Trigorilla Pro logo)
Probably, bacause you never know what they change....

Simply download this repository to your PC, and replace this configuration.h with the one in the Marlin folder.
Then compile and upload to your printer.

After you upload the firmware to the printer, restart it first. Then verify all axis movements via the menu with the smallest steps.
Then check homing all axis individually. For the z axis test homing by pressing both endstop switches yourself,
if they dont work you can turn off the printer in time. If something isn't working as expected, check configuration.h again
and make necessary adjustments.
