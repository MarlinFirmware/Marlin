 *
 * The standard for iostreams is to call flush.  This is very costly for
 * SdFat.  Each call to flush causes 2048 bytes of I/O to the SD.
 *
 * SdFat has a single 512 byte buffer for SD I/O so it must write the current
 * data block to the SD, read the directory block from the SD, update the
 * directory entry, write the directory block to the SD and read the data
 * block back into the buffer.
 *
 * The SD flash memory controller is not designed for this many rewrites
 * so performance may be reduced by more than a factor of 100.
 *
 * If ENDL_CALLS_FLUSH is zero, you must call flush and/or close to force
 * all data to be written to the SD.
