/**
 * MKS BASE with Heroic HR4982 stepper drivers
 */

#include "pins_MKS_BASE.h"

/**
 * Microstepping pins (reverse engineered at V1.4 - due to closed source schematics).
 * Some new boards use HR4982 (Heroic) instead of the A4982 (Allegro) stepper drivers.
 * While most of the functionality is similar, the HR variant obviously doesn't work
 * with diode smoothers (no fast decay). And the Heroic has a 128 µStepping mode where
 * the A4982 is doing quarter steps (MS1=L / MS2=H).
