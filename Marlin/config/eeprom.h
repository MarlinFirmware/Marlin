 * EEPROM
 *
 * The microcontroller can store settings in the EEPROM, e.g. max velocity...
 *  M500 stores parameters in EEPROM
 *  M501 reads parameters from EEPROM (i.e., resets all to last-saved).
 *  M502 reverts current settings to the defaults. (Use M500 after M502 to also reset the EEPROM.)

#define EEPROM_CHITCHAT   // Give feedback on EEPROM commands. Disable to save PROGMEM.
