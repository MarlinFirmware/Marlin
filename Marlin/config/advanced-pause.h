/**
 * Advanced Pause
 * Experimental feature for filament change support and for parking the nozzle when paused.
 * Adds the GCode M600 for initiating filament change.
 * If PARK_HEAD_ON_PAUSE enabled, adds the GCode M125 to pause printing and park the nozzle.
 *
 * Requires an LCD display.
 * Requires NOZZLE_PARK_FEATURE.
 * This feature is required for the default FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SCRIPT.
