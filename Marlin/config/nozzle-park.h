/**
 * Nozzle Park
 *
 * Park the nozzle at the given XYZ position on idle or G27.
 *
 * The "P" parameter controls the action applied to the Z axis:
 *
 *    P0  (Default) If Z is below park Z raise the nozzle.
 *    P1  Raise the nozzle always to Z-park height.
 *    P2  Raise the nozzle by Z-park amount, limited to Z_MAX_POS.
