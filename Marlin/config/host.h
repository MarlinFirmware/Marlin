 * Host Action Commands

 * See https://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#Action_commands
 * Common commands ........ poweroff, pause, paused, resume, resumed, cancel
 * G29_RETRY_AND_RECOVER .. probe_rewipe, probe_failed
 *
 * Some features add reason codes to extend these commands.
 *
 * Host Prompt Support enables Marlin to use the host for user prompts so
 * filament runout and other processes can be managed from the host side.
