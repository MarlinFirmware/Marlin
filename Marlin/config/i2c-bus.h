 * TWI/I2C BUS
 *
 * This feature is an EXPERIMENTAL feature so it shall not be used on production
 * machines. Enabling this will allow you to send and receive I2C data from slave
 * devices on the bus.
 *
 * ; Example #1
 * ; This macro send the string "Marlin" to the slave device with address 0x63 (99)
 * ; It uses multiple M260 commands with one B<base 10> arg
 * M260 A99  ; Target slave address
 * M260 B77  ; M
 * M260 B97  ; a
 * M260 B114 ; r
 * M260 B108 ; l
 * M260 B105 ; i
 * M260 B110 ; n
 * M260 S1   ; Send the current buffer
 *
 * ; Example #2
 * ; Request 6 bytes from slave device with address 0x63 (99)
 * M261 A99 B5
 *
 * ; Example #3
 * ; Example serial output of a M261 request
 * echo:i2c-reply: from:99 bytes:5 data:hello
