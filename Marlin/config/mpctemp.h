/**
 * Model Predictive Control for hotend
 *
 * Use a physical model of the hotend to control temperature. When configured correctly this gives
 * better responsiveness and stability than PID and removes the need for PID_EXTRUSION_SCALING
 * and PID_FAN_SCALING. Enable MPC_AUTOTUNE and use M306 T to autotune the model.
