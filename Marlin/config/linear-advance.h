/**
 * Linear Pressure Control v1.5
 *
 * Assumption: advance [steps] = k * (delta velocity [steps/s])
 * K=0 means advance disabled.
 *
 * NOTE: K values for LIN_ADVANCE 1.5 differ from earlier versions!
 *
 * Set K around 0.22 for 3mm PLA Direct Drive with ~6.5cm between the drive gear and heatbreak.
 * Larger K values will be needed for flexible filament and greater distances.
 * If this algorithm produces a higher speed offset than the extruder can handle (compared to E jerk)
 * print acceleration will be reduced during the affected moves to keep within the limit.
 *
 * See https://marlinfw.org/docs/features/lin_advance.html for full instructions.
