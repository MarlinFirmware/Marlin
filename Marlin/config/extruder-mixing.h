/**
 * "Mixing Extruder"
 *   - Adds G-codes M163 and M164 to set and "commit" the current mix factors.
 *   - Extends the stepping routines to move multiple steppers in proportion to the mix.
 *   - Optional support for Repetier Firmware's 'M164 S<index>' supporting virtual tools.
 *   - This implementation supports up to two mixing extruders.
 *   - Enable DIRECT_MIXING_IN_G1 for M165 and mixing in G1 (from Pia Taubert's reference implementation).
