/**
 * NanoDLP Sync support
 *
 * Add support for Synchronized Z moves when using with NanoDLP. G0/G1 axis moves will output "Z_move_comp"
 * string to enable synchronization with DLP projector exposure. This change will allow to use
 * [[WaitForDoneMessage]] instead of populating your gcode with M400 commands
