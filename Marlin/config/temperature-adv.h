/**
 * Thermal Protection provides additional protection to your printer from damage
 * and fire. Marlin always includes safe min and max temperature ranges which
 * protect against a broken or disconnected thermistor wire.
 *
 * The issue: If a thermistor falls out, it will report the much lower
 * temperature of the air in the room, and the the firmware will keep
 * the heater on.
 *
 * The solution: Once the temperature reaches the target, start observing.
 * If the temperature stays too far below the target (hysteresis) for too
 * long (period), the firmware will halt the machine as a safety precaution.
 *
 * If you get false positives for "Thermal Runaway", increase
 * THERMAL_PROTECTION_HYSTERESIS and/or THERMAL_PROTECTION_PERIOD

 * High Temperature Thermistor Support

 * good readings at room and lower temperatures. This means HEATER_X_RAW_LO_TEMP
 * will probably be caught when the heating element first turns on during the
 * preheating process, which will trigger a min_temp_error as a safety measure
 * and force stop everything.
 * To circumvent this limitation, we allow for a preheat time (during which,
 * min_temp_error won't be triggered) and add a min_temp buffer to handle
 * aberrant readings.

 * If you want to enable this feature for your hotend thermistor(s)
 * uncomment and set values > 0 in the constants below
