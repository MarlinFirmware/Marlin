/**
 * Automatic Temperature Mode
 *
 * Dynamically adjust the hotend target temperature based on planned E moves.
 *
 * (Contrast with PID_EXTRUSION_SCALING, which tracks E movement and adjusts PID
 *  behavior using an additional kC value.)
 *
 * Autotemp is calculated by (mintemp + factor * mm_per_sec), capped to maxtemp.
 *
 * Enable Autotemp Mode with M104/M109 F<factor> S<mintemp> B<maxtemp>.
 * Disable by sending M104/M109 with no F parameter (or F0 with AUTOTEMP_PROPORTIONAL).
