// To buffer a simple "ok" you need 4 bytes.
// For ADVANCED_OK (M105) you need 32 bytes.
// For debug-echo: 128 bytes for the optimal speed.
// Other output doesn't need to be that speedy.

// Without XON/XOFF flow control (see SERIAL_XON_XOFF below) 32 bytes should be enough.
// To use flow control, set this buffer size to at least 1024 bytes.

// Bad Serial-connections can miss a received command by sending an 'ok'
// Therefore some clients abort after 30 seconds in a timeout.
// Some other clients start sending commands while receiving a 'wait'.
// This "wait" is only sent when the buffer is empty. 1 second is a good value here.

// Printrun may have trouble receiving long strings all at once.
// This option inserts short delays between lines of serial output.
