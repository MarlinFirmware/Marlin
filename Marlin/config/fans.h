// Increase the FAN PWM frequency. Removes the PWM noise but increases heating in the FET/Arduino
//#define FAST_PWM_FAN

// Use software PWM to drive the fan, as for the heaters. This uses a very low frequency
// which is not as annoying as with the hardware PWM. On the other hand, if this frequency
// is too low, you should also increment SOFT_PWM_SCALE.
//#define FAN_SOFT_PWM

// Incrementing this by 1 will double the software PWM frequency,
// affecting heaters, and the fan if FAN_SOFT_PWM is enabled.
// However, control resolution will be halved for each increment;
// at zero value, there are 128 effective control positions.
#define SOFT_PWM_SCALE 0

// If SOFT_PWM_SCALE is set to a value higher than 0, dithering can
// be used to mitigate the associated resolution loss. If enabled,
// some of the PWM cycles are stretched so on average the desired
// duty cycle is attained.
//#define SOFT_PWM_DITHER

 * FAST PWM FAN Settings
 *
 * Use to change the FAST FAN PWM frequency (if enabled in Configuration.h)
 * Combinations of PWM Modes, prescale values and TOP resolutions are used internally to produce a
 * frequency as close as possible to the desired frequency.
 *
 * FAST_PWM_FAN_FREQUENCY [undefined by default]
 *   Set this to your desired frequency.
 *   If left undefined this defaults to F = F_CPU/(2*255*1)
 *   ie F = 31.4 Khz on 16 MHz microcontrollers or F = 39.2 KHz on 20 MHz microcontrollers
 *   These defaults are the same as with the old FAST_PWM_FAN implementation - no migration is required
 *   NOTE: Setting very low frequencies (< 10 Hz) may result in unexpected timer behaviour.
 *
 * USE_OCR2A_AS_TOP [undefined by default]
 *   Boards that use TIMER2 for PWM have limitations resulting in only a few possible frequencies on TIMER2:
 *   16MHz MCUs: [62.5KHz, 31.4KHz (default), 7.8KHz, 3.92KHz, 1.95KHz, 977Hz, 488Hz, 244Hz, 60Hz, 122Hz, 30Hz]
 *   20MHz MCUs: [78.1KHz, 39.2KHz (default), 9.77KHz, 4.9KHz, 2.44KHz, 1.22KHz, 610Hz, 305Hz, 153Hz, 76Hz, 38Hz]
 *   A greater range can be achieved by enabling USE_OCR2A_AS_TOP. But note that this option blocks the use of
 *   PWM on pin OC2A. Only use this option if you don't need PWM on 0C2A. (Check your schematic.)
 *   USE_OCR2A_AS_TOP sacrifices duty cycle control resolution to achieve this broader range of frequencies.
