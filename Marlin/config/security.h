/**
 * Password
 *
 * Set a numerical password for the printer which can be requested:
 *
 *  - When the printer boots up
 *  - Upon opening the 'Print from Media' Menu
 *  - When SD printing is completed or aborted
 *
 * The following G-codes can be used:
 *
 *  M510 - Lock Printer. Blocks all commands except M511.
 *  M511 - Unlock Printer.
 *  M512 - Set, Change and Remove Password.
 *
 * If you forget the password and get locked out you'll need to re-flash
 * the firmware with the feature disabled, reset EEPROM, and (optionally)
 * re-flash the firmware again with this feature enabled.
