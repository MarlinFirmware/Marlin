/**
 * Automatic backlash, position, and hotend offset calibration
 *
 * Enable G425 to run automatic calibration using an electrically-
 * conductive cube, bolt, or washer mounted on the bed.
 *
 * G425 uses the probe to touch the top and sides of the calibration object
 * on the bed and measures and/or correct positional offsets, axis backlash
 * and hotend offsets.
 *
 * Note: HOTEND_OFFSET and CALIBRATION_OBJECT_CENTER must be set to within
 *       Â±5mm of true values for G425 to succeed.
