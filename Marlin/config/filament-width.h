/**
 * Filament Width Sensor
 *
 * Measures the filament width in real-time and adjusts
 * flow rate to compensate for any irregularities.
 *
 * Also allows the measured filament diameter to set the
 * extrusion rate, so the slicer only has to specify the
 * volume.
 *
 * Only a single extruder is supported at this time.
 *
 *  34 RAMPS_14    : Analog input 5 on the AUX2 connector
 *  81 PRINTRBOARD : Analog input 2 on the Exp1 connector (version B,C,D,E)
 * 301 RAMBO       : Analog input 3
 *
 * Note: May require analog pins to be defined for other boards.
