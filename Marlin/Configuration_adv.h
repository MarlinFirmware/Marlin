// Example advanced configuration parameters

#error  You must also supply an appropriate set of advanced configuration parameters.

If you are building a configuration based on a sample printer,
  include the Configuration_adv.h file from that folder in place of this file.
  If, as is common, your printer does not have such a file, it uses the default advances settings.
  In that case, you should include the Configuration_adv.h file from the example_configurations/default/ folder.

NOTE: This method of configuration is temporary.
    It should be replaced with another, easier-to-use, mechanism.
