# DWIN for Creality Ender-3 v2

Marlin's Ender-3 v2 support requires the `DWIN_SET` included with the Ender-3 V2 [example configuration](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/tree/bugfix-2.1.x/config/examples/Creality/Ender-3%20V2).

## Easy Install

Copy the `DWIN_SET` folder onto a Micro-SD card and insert the card into the slot on the DWIN screen. Cycle the machine and wait for the screen to go from blue to orange. Turn the machine off and remove the SD card. When you turn on the machine the screen will display a "Creality" loading screen.
