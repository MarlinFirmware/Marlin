/**
 * The algorithm for computing the step is loosely based on the one in Kig
 * (See https://sources.debian.net/src/kig/4:15.08.3-1/misc/kigpainter.cpp/#L759)
 * However, we do not use the stack.
 *
 * The algorithm goes as it follows: the parameters t runs from 0.0 to
 * 1.0 describing the curve, which is evaluated by eval_bezier(). At
 * each iteration we have to choose a step, i.e., the increment of the
 * t variable. By default the step of the previous iteration is taken,
 * and then it is enlarged or reduced depending on how straight the
 * curve locally is. The step is always clamped between MIN_STEP/2 and
 * 2*MAX_STEP. MAX_STEP is taken at the first iteration.
 *
 * For some t, the step value is considered acceptable if the curve in
 * the interval [t, t+step] is sufficiently straight, i.e.,
 * sufficiently close to linear interpolation. In practice the
 * following test is performed: the distance between eval_bezier(...,
 * t+step/2) is evaluated and compared with 0.5*(eval_bezier(...,
 * t)+eval_bezier(..., t+step)). If it is smaller than SIGMA, then the
 * step value is considered acceptable, otherwise it is not. The code
 * seeks to find the larger step value which is considered acceptable.
 *
 * At every iteration the recorded step value is considered and then
 * iteratively halved until it becomes acceptable. If it was already
 * acceptable in the beginning (i.e., no halving were done), then
 * maybe it was necessary to enlarge it; then it is iteratively
 * doubled while it remains acceptable. The last acceptable value
 * found is taken, provided that it is between MIN_STEP and MAX_STEP
 * and does not bring t over 1.0.
 *
 * Caveat: this algorithm is not perfect, since it can happen that a
 * step is considered acceptable even when the curve is not linear at
 * all in the interval [t, t+step] (but its mid point coincides "by
 * chance" with the midpoint according to the parametrization). This
 * kind of glitches can be eliminated with proper first derivative
 * estimates; however, given the improbability of such configurations,
 * the mitigation offered by MIN_STEP and the small computational
 * power available on Arduino, I think it is not wise to implement it.
