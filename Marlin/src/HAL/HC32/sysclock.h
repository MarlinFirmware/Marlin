/**
 * HC32F460 system clock configuration.
 * 
 * With the HC32 HAL, the various peripheral clocks (including the CPU clock) are derived 
 * from the main PLL (MPLL-P) output (referred to at F_SYSTEM_CLOCK).
 * 
 * F_SYSTEM_CLOCK is the target frequency of the main PLL, and the PLL is automatically configured
 * to achieve this frequency.
 * 
 * The peripheral clocks are the result of integer division of F_SYSTEM_CLOCK. 
 * Their target frequencies are defined here, and the required division factors are calculated automatically.
 * Note that the division factor must be a power of 2 between 1 and 64.
 * If the target frequency is not achievable, a compile-time error will be generated.
 * 
 * Additionally, there are interdependencies between the peripheral clocks, which are described in 
 * Section 4.4 "Working Clock Specifications" of the HC32F460 Reference Manual.
 * With Arduino core >= 1.2.0, these interdependencies are checked at compile time.
 * On earlier versions, you are on your own.
 * 
 * For all clock frequencies, they can be checked at runtime by enabling the 'ALWAYS_VALIDATE_CLOCKS' define.
 * In MARLIN_DEV_MODE, they will also be printed to the serial console by 'MarlinHAL::HAL_clock_frequencies_dump'.
 * 
 * See https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/pull/27099 for more information.
