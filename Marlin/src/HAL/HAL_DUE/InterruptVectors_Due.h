/**
 * InterruptVectors_Due.h - This module relocates the Interrupt vector table to SRAM,
 *  allowing to register new interrupt handlers at runtime. Specially valuable and needed
 * because Arduino runtime allocates some interrupt handlers that we NEED to override to
 * properly support extended functionality, as for example, USB host or USB device (MSD, MTP)
 * and custom serial port handlers, and we don't actually want to modify and/or recompile the
 * Arduino runtime. We just want to run as much as possible on Stock Arduino
