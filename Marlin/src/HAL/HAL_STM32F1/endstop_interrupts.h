/**
 * Endstop interrupts for Libmaple STM32F1 based targets.
 *
 * On STM32F, all pins support external interrupt capability.
 * Any pin can be used for external interrupts, but there are some restrictions.
 * At most 16 different external interrupts can be used at one time.
 * Further, you canâ€™t just pick any 16 pins to use. This is because every pin on the STM32
 * connects to what is called an EXTI line, and only one pin per EXTI line can be used for external interrupts at a time
 * Check the Reference Manual of the MCU to confirm which line is used by each pin
 */

/**
 * Endstop Interrupts
 *
 * Without endstop interrupts the endstop pins must be polled continually in
 * the temperature-ISR via endstops.update(), most of the time finding no change.
 * With this feature endstops.update() is called only when we know that at
 * least one endstop has changed state, saving valuable CPU cycles.
 *
 * This feature only works when all used endstop pins can generate an 'external interrupt'.
 *
 * Test whether pins issue interrupts on your board by flashing 'pin_interrupt_test.ino'.
 * (Located in Marlin/buildroot/share/pin_interrupt_test/pin_interrupt_test.ino)
