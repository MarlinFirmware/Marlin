 * Stringize a preprocessing token, this token being allowed to be \#defined.
 *
 * May be used only within macros with the token passed as an argument if the token is \#defined.
 *
 * For example, writing STRINGZ(PIN) within a macro \#defined by PIN_NAME(PIN)
 * and invoked as PIN_NAME(PIN0) with PIN0 \#defined as A0 is equivalent to
 * writing "A0".
