/**
 * HARDWARE VS. SOFTWARE SPI COMPATIBILITY
 *
 * DUE selects hardware vs. software SPI depending on whether one of the hardware-controllable SDSS pins is in use.
 *
 * The hardware SPI controller doesn't allow software SPIs to control any shared pins.
 *
 * When DUE software SPI is used then Trinamic drivers must use the TMC softSPI.
 *
 * When DUE hardware SPI is used then a Trinamic driver can use either its hardware SPI or, if there are no shared
 * pins, its software SPI.
 *
 * Usually the hardware SPI pins are only available to the LCD. This makes the DUE hard SPI used at the same time
 * as the TMC2130 soft SPI the most common setup.
