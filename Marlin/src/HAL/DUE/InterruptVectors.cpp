 * because Arduino runtime allocates some interrupt handlers that we NEED to override to
 * properly support extended functionality, as for example, USB host or USB device (MSD, MTP)
 * and custom serial port handlers, and we don't actually want to modify and/or recompile the
 * Arduino runtime. We just want to run as much as possible on Stock Arduino
