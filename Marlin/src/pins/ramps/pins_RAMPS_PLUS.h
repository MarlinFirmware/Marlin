/**
 * Arduino Mega with RAMPS v1.4Plus, also known as 3DYMY version, pin assignments
 * ATmega2560, ATmega1280
 *
 * Applies to the following boards:
 *
 *  RAMPS_PLUS_EFB (Extruder, Fan, Bed)
 *  RAMPS_PLUS_EEB (Extruder, Extruder, Bed)
 *  RAMPS_PLUS_EFF (Extruder, Fan, Fan)
 *  RAMPS_PLUS_EEF (Extruder, Extruder, Fan)
 *  RAMPS_PLUS_SF  (Spindle, Controller Fan)
 *
 * Differences from RAMPS v1.4:
 *  - Swap heater E0 with E1
 *  - Swap pins 8 and 10. Bed/Fan/Hotend as labeled on the board are on pins 8/9/10.
 *  - Change EXP1/2 pins
