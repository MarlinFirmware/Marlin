/**
 * Arduino Due with RAMPS-SMART pin assignments
 *
 * Applies to the following boards:
 *
 *  RAMPS_SMART_EFB (Hotend, Fan, Bed)
 *  RAMPS_SMART_EEB (Hotend0, Hotend1, Bed)
 *  RAMPS_SMART_EFF (Hotend, Fan0, Fan1)
 *  RAMPS_SMART_EEF (Hotend0, Hotend1, Fan)
 *  RAMPS_SMART_SF  (Spindle, Controller Fan)
 *
 *  Differences between
 *  RAMPS_14 | RAMPS-SMART
 *      NONE | D16 (Additional AUX-3 pin(AUX3_2PIN), shares the same pin with AUX4_18PIN)
 *      NONE | D17 (Additional AUX-3 pin(AUX3_1PIN), shares the same pin with AUX4_17PIN)
 *        D0 | NONE
 *        D1 | NONE
 *    A3/D57 | NONE
 *    A4/D58 | NONE
 *    A5/D59 | A3/D57
 *    A9/D63 | A4/D58
 *   A10/D64 | A5/D59
 *   A11/D65 | D66
 *   A12/D66 | D67
 *       A13 | A9
 *       A14 | A10
 *       A15 | A11
 *
 *
 * REPRAP_DISCOUNT_FULL_GRAPHIC_SMART_CONTROLLER works fine connected to AUX-4 with
 * Smart Adapter, but requires removing the AUX3 pin header on the adapter to fit.
 * To use the SD card reader, wire its pins to AUX-3 (and use Software SPI).
 *
 * To use Hardware SPI for SD, the SDSS pin must be set to 52 instead of 53.
 * Hardware SPI also requires additional wiring because the board doesn't pass
 * the 6-pin SPI header from the DUE board.
 * (Search the web for "Arduino DUE Board Pinout" to see the correct header.)
