/// A complete set of error codes which may be a result of a high-level command/operation.
/// This header file shall be included in the printer's firmware as well as a reference,
/// therefore the error codes have been extracted to one place.
///
/// Please note the errors are intentionally coded as "negative" values (highest bit set),
/// becase they are a complement to reporting the state of the high-level state machines -
/// positive values are considered as normal progress, negative values are errors.
///
/// Please note, that multiple TMC errors can occur at once, thus they are defined as a bitmask of the higher byte.
/// Also, as there are 3 TMC drivers on the board, each error is added a bit for the corresponding TMC -
/// TMC_PULLEY_BIT, TMC_SELECTOR_BIT, TMC_IDLER_BIT,
/// The resulting error is a bitwise OR over 3 TMC drivers and their status, which should cover most of the situations correctly.
