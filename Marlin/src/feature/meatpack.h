/*
 * MeatPack G-code Compression
 *
 * Algorithm & Implementation: Scott Mudge - mail@scottmudge.com
 * Date: Dec. 2020
 *
 * Specifically optimized for 3D printing G-Code, this is a zero-cost data compression method
 * which packs ~180-190% more data into the same amount of bytes going to the CNC controller.
 * As a majority of G-Code can be represented by a restricted alphabet, I performed histogram
 * analysis on a wide variety of 3D printing gcode samples, and found ~93% of all gcode could
 * be represented by the same 15-character alphabet.
 *
 * This allowed me to design a system of packing 2 8-bit characters into a single byte, assuming
 * they fall within this limited 15-character alphabet. Using a 4-bit lookup table, these 8-bit
 * characters can be represented by a 4-bit index.
 *
 * Combined with some logic to allow commingling of full-width characters outside of this 15-
 * character alphabet (at the cost of an extra 8-bits per full-width character), and by stripping
 * out unnecessary comments, the end result is gcode which is roughly half the original size.
 *
 * Why did I do this? I noticed micro-stuttering and other data-bottleneck issues while printing
 * objects with high curvature, especially at high speeds. There is also the issue of the limited
 * baud rate provided by Prusa's Atmega2560-based boards, over the USB serial connection. So soft-
 * ware like OctoPrint would also suffer this same micro-stuttering and poor print quality issue.

/**
 * Commands sent to MeatPack to control its behavior.

 * Provided that 0xFF is an exceedingly rare character that is virtually never
 * present in G-code naturally, it is safe to assume 2 in sequence should never
 * happen naturally, and so it is used as a signal here.
 *
 * 0xFF *IS* used in "packed" G-code (used to denote that the next 2 characters are
 * full-width), however 2 in a row will never occur, as the next 2 bytes will always
