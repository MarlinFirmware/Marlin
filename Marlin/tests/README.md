These test files are executed by the unit-tests built from the `<root>/test` folder.

These are placed outside of the main PlatformIO test folder so we can collect all test files and compile them into multiple PlatformIO test binaries. This enables tests to be executed against a variety of Marlin configurations.

To execute these tests, refer to the top-level Makefile.
