# Introduction

**You now have the option of integrating profiles for the two main Delta printers: the QQS and the Q5.** 

To do this you need to download the pack **"Date-PS_FLSun_profiles.zip"** then you just have to unzip it in the "resources/profiles" directory of your PrusaSlicer installation folder. 

Once done, launch prusa-slicer.exe and the user interface appears, you can launch the wizard to add the profiles of the printer of your choice.

**Note:** This pack will be integrated in the next version of PrusaSlicer 2.3 and above.

# 1. Slicers configuration files

You will find here 2 types of configuration files, Cura and Prusa Slic3r configuration files

- [1. Slicers configuration files](#1-slicers-configuration-files)
  - [1.1. File naming convention](#11-file-naming-convention)
  - [1.2. How to import Prusa Slic3r config bundle](#12-how-to-import-prusa-slic3r-config-bundle)
  - [1.3. How to import Cura configuration](#13-how-to-import-cura-configuration)

## 1.1. File naming convention

We are applying this naming convention on configuration files:  
[slicer]-[Release]-[Text]-[Version].[Extension]  
Example: *PrusaSlicer-2.2.0-config_bundle_FLSUN_QQS-v1.ini*

## 1.2. How to import Prusa Slic3r config bundle

Download the right config bundle file (**Take care about the version of the file for the right release of Prusa Slic3r**)  
Start Prusa Slic3r  
Select File -> Import -> Import Config **Bundle** ... for a pack of **Presets/Filaments/Printers**

and -> Import Config... for a **single** pack Preset/Filament/Printer.
